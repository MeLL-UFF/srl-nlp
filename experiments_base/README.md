#How to use this experiment base

##It is not supposed to allow you run the experiments.

If you want to run the experiments you should checkout the branch of this particular experiment, it is necessary because each experiment was run in a different version of the software. Ideally when this project is complete I will have made the experiments run with no problem in the newest code.

##It is intended to be a log of the experiments

You can se each experiment and see te results achieved and also all the configurations
