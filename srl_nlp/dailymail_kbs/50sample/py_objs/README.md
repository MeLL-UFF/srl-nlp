# PyObjs

This folder contains json files serialized by python using as base the data examples. There are some kinds of files:

* _few\_predicates_: files processed by boxer.py with the option -e
* _expanded_unprocessed_: files processed by boxer.py with the option -e
* _expanded_processed_: files processed by boxer.py with the option -e and then with some manual fixes
* _expanded_processed_tagged:_ same as expanded_processed, but with every question having a tag (who, what, where,how)
